Fluid forms provide a fluid-width form layout that adapts to their
container. They are designed for full-width form layouts and work with most Carbon
input components. Note that inline input variants cannot be used within a
fluid form.

## Fluid form

Create a fluid-width form layout using the fluid form component. This example
shows a basic login form with required fields.

<FluidForm>
  <TextInput labelText="User name" placeholder="Enter user name..." required />
  <PasswordInput
    required
    type="password"
    labelText="Password"
    placeholder="Enter password..."
  />
</FluidForm>

## Invalid state

Handle form validation and display error states using the `invalid` and
`invalidText` props on form inputs. This example demonstrates how to show
validation errors in a fluid form.
