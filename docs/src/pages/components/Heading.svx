Heading and section components work together to automatically manage semantic heading hierarchy in your application. The heading component automatically adjusts its heading level (h1–h6) based on the nesting depth of section components, ensuring proper document structure and accessibility without manual level management.

## Default

A top-level heading inside a section renders as an `h1` element. This provides a semantic starting point for your document structure.

<Section>
  <Heading>Heading 1</Heading>
</Section>

## Nested sections

As you nest section components, the heading levels automatically increment to maintain proper hierarchy. Each nested section increases the heading level by one (h1 → h2 → h3, etc.). Heading levels are automatically capped at `h6` to ensure valid HTML structure, even if you nest deeper than six levels.

<Section>
  <Heading>Heading 1</Heading>
  <Section>
    <Heading>Heading 2</Heading>
    <Section>
      <Heading>Heading 3</Heading>
      <Section>
        <Heading>Heading 4</Heading>
        <Section>
          <Heading>Heading 5</Heading>
          <Section>
            <Heading>Heading 6</Heading>
            <Section>
              <Heading>Capped at Heading 6</Heading>
            </Section>
          </Section>
        </Section>
      </Section>
    </Section>
  </Section>
</Section>

## Custom level

Use the `level` prop on the section to specify a custom starting heading level. This is useful when you need to start a section at a specific level, such as when embedding content that should begin at a higher heading level. Child sections will continue to increment from this custom level.

<Section level={5}>
  <Heading>Starts at Heading 5</Heading>
  <Section>
    <Heading>Heading 6</Heading>
  </Section>
</Section>

## Custom section element

By default, the section renders a semantic `<section>` element. Use the `tag` prop to render a different HTML element while maintaining the heading level context functionality. This is useful when you need to use a different semantic element (like `<div>`, `<article>`, or `<aside>`) but still want automatic heading level management.

<Section tag="div">
  <Heading>Heading 1</Heading>
</Section>
